# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The main idea behind this analysis was to better understand the differences between the different city types. On overall averages and totals of metrics wouldn't give much direction because the overall average is more likely to apply to urban areas due to the grater number of rides. Suburban and Rural areas must be treated differently due to there being a difference in users. 

## Results

### Differences in City Types
There were 1,000 more rides in Urban cities than there were in Suburban cities and 500 more rides in Suburban cities than there were in Rural cities. Metric comparisons can be seen below:

The biggest takeaways are from the average ride fare and the average driver fare and the incremental changes between the different city types. 

#### Average ride fare
The difference between the city types makes sense. Rural ride fares are about $4 more than Suburban ride fares, and Urban ride fares are about $6 less than Subruban ride fares. This makes a lot of sense in terms of miles per drive and the amount of drivers available per city type.

#### Average driver fare
This was calculated based on the total fare amount for the city type divided by the total amount of drivers for that city type. Based on the data there are far more drivers per fare in urban areas than there are in rural areas indicated by the low average driver fare. Theorectically, if the suburban average driver fare was spot at $2.26 then the urban areas don't need anymore drivers unless there start becoming more rides or higher fares and they need to hire rural drivers immediately to help accomate for the demand. 

### Fares by City Type Overtime (Weekly)
The only rise or fall that all city types had at the same time was during the last week in Febuary and the second week in March where all fares spiked. Fares stay mostly steady and the city types never change position with Urban always making the most and Rural always making the least.

## Summary
The Urban cities could possibly do with fewer drivers or they might need to eliminate drivers that haven't drove in a while from the database to really understand how well staffed those areas are. There might be one city in particular that doesn't have a high fare total but has an abundance of drivers. There is no real seasonality in terms of fare during the specified date range (1/1/2019 - 4/29/2019) but we might find there to be one if we analyzed the whole year or a few years.
